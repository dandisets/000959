description: These are the raw and processed data accompanying our manuscript "Closed-loop
  microstimulations of the orbitofrontal cortex during real-life gaze interaction
  enhance dynamic social attention". In this paradigm, two animals face each-other
  and freely gaze at one another while their gaze positions are continuously tracked
  in real-time. One animal ("M1") receives a low-amplitude microstimulation to one
  of three brain areas (OFC, ACCg, and dmPFC) that is triggered stochastically upon
  looking to their partner's eye-region. These data consist of the continuous gaze
  positions and pupil sizes from each animal; the stimulation event times; the face
  and eye ROIs of each animal; and the multi-unit activity (MUA) and electrode information
  from the single electrode targeting the stimulated area.
